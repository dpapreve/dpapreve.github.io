## The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as `VC`).

The first three observations of the dataset:

```{r}
head(ToothGrowth, 3)
```

A box plot:

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)

ToothGrowth |> 
  mutate(dose = as.factor(dose)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = dose, y = len, fill = dose)) +  
  geom_boxplot()
```
